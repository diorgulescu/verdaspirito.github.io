<h1>Hey, you!</h1>

Welcome to my public page! Since I am barely using any social media, this is the place where I write down my thoughts, impressions and interesting things I come across while working on various projects. Maybe some things could prove useful to others. 

<h1>Journals</h1>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="{{ "/tech" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Tech blog</a></b> - This is where I try writing about technical stuff, mostly about Linux, FreeBSD, Python and Quality Assurance (hopefully some tech doc work in the near future...)</li>
	<li><b><a href="{{ "/filosofeli" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Thoughts</a></b> - A place where all my blabbering nonsense end up. Social issues, digital minimalism, self assessment, existential crisis and such</li>
	<li><b><a href="{{ "/music" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Music</a></b> - Album reviews and posts about making music, playing bass/drums/synths &amp; home (or small studio) recordings</li>
</ul>

<h1>Work</h1>

	<li><h2>Tutorials</h2></li>

	<li><h2>Open Source projects</h2></li>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="https://github.com/diorgulescu/suckless-ubuntu">Suckless Ubuntu</a></b> - An attempt at setting up a minimalist, deep work-centered Linux distribution based on Ubuntu LTS</li>
	<li><b><a href="https://github.com/diorgulescu/DAMF">DAMF (Device Automation & Management Framework)</a></b> - Framework for easy test lab and test automation management. Mainly focused on embedded environments. Currently under a massive overhaul that's been severely stalled by lack of time</li>
	<li><b><a href="">Min browser</a></b> - Translations and, hopefully, some more testing.
</ul>
<li><h2>Music</h2>

I love playing the six string bass and some digital synths. If needed, I can also play some drum beats for bluesy, sludgy or strange music. Occasionally, I like chilling out while mixing some tracks. You can check out my noisy output on <a href="https://www.bandcamp.com/sentem">Bandcamp</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dragos-iorgulescu-11755182">Soundcloud</a>
</li>
<li><h2>Photography</h2>

	Life and nature come together in a nice photo, as well as other abstract ideas. I play the "Amateur Photographer" game on <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/g/diorgulescu">Shutterstock</a>, so you may check some of those out in case you're curious.

<h1>Getting in touch</h1>
